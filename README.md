Note from author - this API was created during GovHack 2016, and the API for PokemonGo was easy to figure out. During the competition, an update was released, breaking every API implementation that had been created. Thus, the API will no longer work.

# PGAPI
A Swift wrapper for the Pokemon Go API (GovHack 2016)

Features Google + PTC login, getting profile and inventory data.

Documentation + delay workaround soon
